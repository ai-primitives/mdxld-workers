# Test Failures

## Version and Help Command Tests
1. `should show version when --version flag is used`
   - Expected console.log to be called at least once
   - Exit code handling incorrect (throwing wrong error message)

2. `should show help when --help flag is used`
   - Expected console.log to be called at least once
   - Exit code handling incorrect (throwing wrong error message)

3. `should show help when no command is provided`
   - Expected console.log to be called at least once
   - Exit code handling incorrect (throwing wrong error message)

## Command Implementation Tests
4. `should have compile command`
   - Missing console output for successful compilation

5. `should have deploy-platform command`
   - Missing console output for successful deployment

6. `should have deploy-wrangler command`
   - Missing console output for successful deployment

## Root Causes
1. exitOverride handler not correctly distinguishing between help/version and error cases
2. Console output not being properly triggered before exit
3. Command implementations not logging success messages

## Next Steps
1. Fix exitOverride handler to properly handle different exit scenarios
2. Ensure console output is called before any exit handling
3. Add proper success messages to command implementations
