# Test Failures Analysis

## CLI Test Failures

1. Process Exit Error

   ```
   Expected [Function] to throw error including 'process.exit unexpectedly called with "0"'
   but got 'process.exit unexpectedly called with "1"'
   ```

2. LogSpy Failures
   a. Version Flag Test

   ```
   Expected "log" to be called with arguments: [ "0.1.0" ]
   Received: Number of calls: 0
   ```

   b. Help Flag Test

   ```
   Expected "log" to be called with arguments: [ StringContaining "Usage:" ]
   Received: Number of calls: 0
   ```

   c. No Command Test

   ```
   Expected "log" to be called with arguments: [ StringContaining "Usage:" ]
   Received: Number of calls: 0
   ```

## Root Causes

1. Commander.js exitOverride implementation not properly capturing console output
2. Process exit handling interfering with log capture
3. Test spy setup may not be correctly intercepting console.log calls

## Current Status

- Known limitation documented in TODO.md
- Development focus shifted to core compilation features
- CLI improvements deferred until after core functionality implementation

## Next Steps

1. Continue with core MDXLD compilation implementation
2. Return to CLI improvements after core features
3. Consider alternative approaches to CLI output testing
