## Technical Challenges & Blockers

- [ ] Build Configuration
  - [ ] tsup build failures
    - Issue: No input files found for tsup build
    - Location: CI build step
    - Impact: Prevents package compilation
    - Resolution: Need to specify entry points in build configuration
- [ ] Test Implementation Issues
  - [ ] TypeError in Core Function Tests
    - Issue: "TypeError: add is not a function"
    - Location: src/index.test.ts:6:12
    - Impact: Prevents test suite from passing
    - Resolution: Need to implement or mock add function
  - [ ] WORKER_CONTEXT Missing
    - Issue: "Error: WORKER_CONTEXT not found in output"
    - Location: src/compiler/**tests**/index.test.ts
    - Impact: Multiple test failures in compiler tests
    - Occurrences: Lines 32, 78, 104, 128, 160
    - Resolution: Need to properly set up worker context in test environment
  - [ ] YAML-LD Parsing Errors
    - Issue: "Failed to parse worker context: SyntaxError: Expected ',' or '}' after property value in JSON"
    - Location: src/compiler/__tests__/index.test.ts
    - Impact: Test failures in metadata handling
    - Details: JSON parsing errors in worker context extraction
    - Status: In Progress - Improved JSON parsing implementation
    - Resolution: Enhanced metadata field handling and JSON structure preservation
- [ ] Cloudflare Workers Integration
  - [ ] Verify Platform API access and permissions
  - [ ] Test worker deployment process
  - [x] Validate TypeScript configuration compatibility
    - [x] Add DOM lib for fetch API support
    - [x] Configure JSX for Hono compatibility
  - [x] ESLint Configuration
    - [x] Add webextensions environment for fetch API support
    - [x] Resolve no-undef errors for web APIs
- [ ] MDXLD Processing
  - [ ] Ensure proper YAML-LD metadata handling
  - [ ] Verify JSX transformation accuracy
  - [ ] Test complex MDX component scenarios
- [x] Dependencies
  - [x] mdxld version compatibility
    - Issue: mdxld@^1.0.0 not available (latest: 0.1.3)
    - Status: Resolved - Updated to latest version
    - Impact: None - Build passing with current version
    - Resolution: Successfully integrated with current version
  - [ ] Type Definition Mismatches
    - Issue: MDXLD type from mdxld package has optional properties that our implementation requires
    - Location: src/compiler/index.ts
    - Impact: TypeScript build failures in CI
    - Details:
      - Property 'type' is optional in mdxld but required in our implementation
      - Property 'context' has incompatible type definitions
      - WorkerConfig type needs proper property definitions for 'name' and 'routes'
      - Error: Property 'name' does not exist on type 'object'
      - Error: Property 'routes' does not exist on type 'object'
    - Resolution: Need to update our MDXLD and WorkerConfig types to handle optional properties correctly
- [x] Test Implementation

  - [x] Fix Vitest module mocking issues
    - [x] Move vi.mock() calls to top of file
    - [x] Properly import mocked functions in tests
    - [x] Handle Commander.js process.exit mocking
  - [x] Verify test coverage for all commands
  - [x] Commander.js Test Failures (Resolved)
    - Issue: "Error: process.exit unexpectedly called with code X"
    - Location: src/cli/index.test.ts
    - Cause: Commander.js calling process.exit() in test environment
    - Status: Fixed by restoring help command functionality
    - Resolution:
      - Added .addHelpCommand() and .showHelpAfterError()
      - Configured output handling with configureOutput()
      - All CLI tests now passing
      - Help text properly captured in tests
